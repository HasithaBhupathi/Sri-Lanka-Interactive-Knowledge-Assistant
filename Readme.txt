###################################### Applications Information #####################################

This project is an AI-powered interactive Q&A application designed to provide accurate, structured, 
and engaging information about Sri Lanka. Built using Python, Streamlit, and a natural language 
processing model, the system is trained on a comprehensive reference dataset covering Sri Lanka’s
geography, history, economy, governance, culture, religion, education, and more. Users can type 
questions in natural language, and the chatbot responds with contextually relevant, human-like 
answers, making it a powerful educational and informational tool. The application serves as a virtual
guide, ideal for students, researchers, travelers, or anyone interested in learning about Sri Lanka. 
It not only presents factual data but also helps users explore deeper cultural, historical, and 
socio-economic aspects of the country in an accessible conversational format. The user-friendly 
Streamlit interface includes a sidebar with an introduction and project information, while the backend
is powered by a Python-based virtual environment for package management and deployment. By combining 
AI-driven Q&A capabilities with a rich, domain-specific dataset, this project demonstrates how modern 
technology can be used to create dynamic and interactive learning experiences.

###################################### User Manual ##################################################

Step 1. Make a new folder (eg, Sri Lanka Interactive Knowledge Assistant)  for our application.
Step 2. Copy our application files (App.py, main.py, requirements.txt, and Readme.txt ) into that folder.
Step 3. In that folder, create a virtual environment using the command "python3.10.0 -m venv venv_" on the
        Command prompt. This creates a folder named venv_ containing the isolated Python environment.

         Produce Item Picker & Price Calculator/
         ├── venv_/                  
         │   └── ...                # Python interpreter and libraries installed here
         ├── App.py                 # ✅ Streamlit application file
         ├── main.py,               # ✅ Main Python files
         ├── requirements.txt       # ✅ List of required libraries with versions
         └── Readme.txt             # ℹ️ Project description and usage instructions            

Step 4. Activate the created virtual environment (venv_) using the command "venv_\Scripts\activate"
        on your Command prompt. Then you’ll see the environment name (venv_) appears in your command prompt.
Step 5. Now you can install libraries using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Step 6. Now you can run the application using the command "streamlit run App.py"
Step 7. When you are done, you can deactivate the created virtual environment (venv_) using the
        command "deactivate".
